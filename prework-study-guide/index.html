        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
            <l>HTML creates the structure of a webpage. Its elements work together to provide content and the basic framework for all web pages, making it easy for users to navigate the webpage.</l>
            <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage; they also divide content on the page and describe it to browsers and developers.</li>
         <li>Some HTML elements are visible to users, and others provide important information about an HTML document and website used by the browser so that the page renders correctly.</li>
         <li>This [!DOCTYPE html] is a declaration, it tells the browser what document type to expect when opened.</li>   
         <li>The [html] opening tag represents the root, or start, of our HTML document</li>
          <li>The [head] element contains information about the webpage or metadata. </li>
          <li>Metadata is webpage data the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Typically not seen by users but contains essential information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>Let's examine the metadata elements in the [head] of our HTML code.</li>
          <li>The [title] element defines the title of a webpage and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
          <li>The [style] element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li> The [base] element defines the base URL for a webpage. </li>
          <li>The [meta] element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li> The s[cript] element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>  The [link] element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
        
          <li> The [body] element defines the document's body,  containing visible user content. All the content we want to display to users must be inside the body element.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. The parent element that holds all the children, in this case, the [body], is the parent element. </li>
          <li>Semantic HTML element clearly describes their meaning to both the browser and the developer.</li>
          <li> It plays a vital role in ensuring your webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, including those using assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>
          <li>Let's examine the semantic HTML elements in the [body] of our HTML code.</li>
          <li>The [header] appears at the top of the page and usually contains a navigation menu and introductory content.</li>
          <li>The [main] element Specifies the main content of a document.</li>
          <li>The [nav] element defines a set of navigation links.</li>
          <li>The [aside] element defines some content aside from where it is placed (like a sidebar).</li>
          <li>The [section] element defines a section in a document.</li>
          <li>The [article] element specifies independent, self-contained content.</li>
          <li>The [footer] element defines a footer for a document or section.</li>
        </ul>
